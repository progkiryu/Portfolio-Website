This is built using Vite as a development server, integrated with React as the front-end framework and Node as the dependency manager.
Utilised Tailwind CSS and TypedJS for quick styling, as well as EmailJS to send queries from the website to my email.

## Setup
To run the application mode in development, run:
```
npm run dev -- --host
```
The '-- --host' part enables you to view the development server on different devices within the same network.
