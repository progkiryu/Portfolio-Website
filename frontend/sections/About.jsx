        <h1>My name is Denver Klein Mesa</h1>

        <p>
        I am currently in my penultimate year/3rd year studying Software Engineering at UTS, and harbor a strong passion
        towards programming and developing applications. This all originated from my liking towards game development through
        Scratch, C# and Python, in which I produced small-scale games during high school. And with my entrance to the software
        industry, I hope to not only improve my current coding skillset, but to utilise it in solving real-world problems.
